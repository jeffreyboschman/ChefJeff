## Steps
- Heat large skillet over medium heat. Add ground beef. Break beef up with utensil while cooking. Cook ~5 minutes, until the meat starts releasing its juices.
	- I like to use my cast iron skillet
- Drain excess grease from the skillet. Return to stove, reduce heat to low
- Add diced onion and garlic. Cook until they are done.
- Add spices and (optional) tomato sauce. Sit until meat is coated.
	- The tomato sauce thickens it up and helps the spices stick to the meat
- Simmer for 5 minutes
