## Ingredients

- [[Homemade Teriyaki Sauce]]
- [[Flour]]
- Salt
- Pepper

## Steps
- Cut up chicken thighs into large pieces, but still thin enough to cook quickly
- Add salt and pepper to chicken pieces
- Lightly brush flour over the chicken pieces
	- the flour helps to make the outside brown/crispy and helps the sauce stick
- Grill chicken until browned on each side
	- I like to use my cast iron pan on medium-high
- Add liberal amount of homemade teriyaki sauce (enough to cover the bottom of the pan)
- Cook until sauce has thickened and reduced, mixing to coat the chicken
