## Steps
- Preheat oven to 400 F.  Place sweet potato chunks into a large bowl and toss with oil and sea salt. Bake for 30 minutes or until cooked through, flipping once. Remove from oven and let the potato chunks cool. 
	- This step can be done ahead of time. Just keep the roasted potatoes in the fridge and complete step 2 the day you want to enjoy the salad.
- Meanwhile, place Dressing ingredients in a jar, mix with a teaspoon (to get honey off the base) then shake well until combined.
- Toast pecans in a dry skillet over medium high heat for 3 minutes, or until they smell nutty. Remove pecans.
- Add bacon and cook until golden.
- To assemble, place everything in a bowl, reserving some bacon, pecans and feta cheese for garnish. Drizzle with most of the dressing, then toss gently.
- Transfer into a serving bowl, garnish with remaining bacon, pecans and feta cheese. Drizzle with remaining dressing. Serve!
