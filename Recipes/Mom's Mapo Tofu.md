## Steps
- Cook ground pork until done. Drain off excess fat
	- I like to use wok on medium-high heat
- Meanwhile, cut up tofu and microwave so its already hot. 
- Add miso and sugar to pork. Make sure it's not too salty. 
	- Miso kinda replaces the texture of gochujang? 
- Add garlic, ginger, green onion, and lao gan ma. Mix all together. 
- Add black vinegar, soy sauce and oyster sauce. Mix all together. 
- Add chicken stock and tofu. Let simmer for 5 minutes.
- Add corn starch with water to thicken sauce.
