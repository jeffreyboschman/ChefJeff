## How to use git (for Melissa)
These steps are for my fianc√©, who has never used git before.

Step 0: 
Make sure git is installed. 
`git --version`
	
The very first time you use git, you need to set up your credentials:
	`git config --global user.name "Melissa L"`
	`git config --global user.email "<your email>"`
- you shouldn't have to do this anymore after the first time. You can always check to make sure you're still "logged in" with:
		`something`
		
Step 0 (for Jeffrey):
`cd ~/Documents/Personal/ChefJeff`
`git init`
- this makes a `.git` file in this directory
